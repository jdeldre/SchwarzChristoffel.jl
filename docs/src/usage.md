# Basic usage

```@meta

Let's first initiate the module. We'll also initiate plotting with [Plots.jl](http://docs.juliaplots.org/latest/), using PyPlot as the backend for the actual output.
```@repl mapconstruct
using SchwarzChristoffel
using Plots
pyplot()
```

Now, we create a polygon shape by specifying its vertices. Note that the vertices must be provided in counter-clockwise order.

```@repl mapconstruct
x = [-1.0,0.2,1.0,-1.0]; y = [-1.0,-1.0,0.5,1.0];
p = Polygon(x,y)
```

Let's plot the polygon to make sure it matches what we wanted.
```@repl mapconstruct
plot(p)
savefig("polygon4.svg"); nothing # hide
```

![](polygon4.svg)

Now, we create the map from the unit circle to the polygon.

```@repl mapconstruct
m = ExteriorMap(p)
```

Let's visualize what we've constructed. Here, we will inspect the
mapping from the exterior of the unit circle to the exterior of the polygon.

```@repl mapconstruct
plot(m)
savefig("polygongrid.svg"); nothing # hide
```
![](polygongrid.svg)


We can now easily evaluate the map at any place we like. It could be evaluated
outside the unit circle:
```@repl mapconstruct
ζ = 1.2 + 0.1im
m(ζ)
```

or it could be evaluated inside the unit circle:
```@repl mapconstruct
ζ = 0.5 + 0.1im
m(ζ;inside=true)
```

We can also evaluate the first and second derivative of the map at any place(s).
Let's evaluate at a range of points outside the circle.
```@repl mapconstruct
dm = DerivativeMap(m)
ζ = collect(1.1:0.1:2.0) + 0.1im
dz,ddz = dm(ζ);
dz
```
```@setup mapconstruct2
using SchwarzChristoffel
using Plots
pyplot()
default(grid = false, color=:colorbrewer)
```

Now let's try a more interesting shape. Here's a star-shaped body
```@repl mapconstruct2
n = 8; dθ = 2π/(2n)
θ = collect(0:dθ:2π-dθ)
w = (1+0.3cos.(n*θ)).*exp.(im*θ)
p = Polygon(w)
plot(p)
savefig("polygon8.svg"); nothing # hide
```
![](polygon8.svg)


Construct the map and plot it
```@repl mapconstruct2
m = ExteriorMap(p)
plot(m)
savefig("polygongrid8.svg"); nothing # hide
```
![](polygongrid8.svg)
